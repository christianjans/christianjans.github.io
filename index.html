Dear Jana Louise,<br/>
<br/>
Coming at you a little different this time around. Man has it ever been a crazy
few weeks since I last wrote to you. My goal was always to get this next
letter to you on the weekend of your brother‚Äôs wedding (don‚Äôt worry, I didn‚Äôt
forget), but I thought I would have so much more time to write it! I definitely
did not anticipate getting sick, or how busy work would have been, but I am glad
I can take some time now to sit down and write out my thoughts to you again :).
Apologies for the delay on getting it to you in this format, it was a little
harder than anticipated to get it up online.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have been doing well, though, I guess I already know how you have
been doing. We talk all the time! I know that this is something I will miss come
the fall when you will no doubt be busy with almost as many classes as one has
fingers ‚Äì crazy üíÄ. I‚Äôm excited though, because it's another challenge that we
can face and work through together, with the help of our God.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that I‚Äôve never asked you this before (despite all the times I‚Äôve had
to "[ask] you one thing that I‚Äôve always wanted to [ask] you‚Äù): do you like
challenges? Are they something you like to face? Or something you more naturally
tend to shy away from? I did some reflection, and I know for me, certain
challenges like games or competitions are challenges I love to face head-on.
When we were younger, our Uncle Monkey would host ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù in the basement
of our Grandparents after Sunday dinners. Here, he would make up games or
exercises for my siblings and I to work through and have some fun. These are the
types of challenges that I like, those that I feel like I can accomplish (or at
least give an honest try) under my own strength. While other challenges, perhaps
those that maybe just seem a bit more connected to real-life, like the challenge
of finding a job or those that I don‚Äôt feel like I have control over, are
challenges I tend to shy away from (or at least certainly don‚Äôt look forward
to).<br/>
<br/>
This summer, for some reason, I have really seen the importance of verse
memorization and being able to recall aspects about God and His promises in
various situations. I love to see how you do that so often as we go through
Psalms, or even as we just talk about our day. I think one of the first verses
I ever memorized was Proverbs 3:5-6, it was also the verse that I mentioned in
my baptism testimony. Recently, I have been thinking about this in the context
of challenges in my life, whether those be busy times at work or uncertainty
about the future. I find it helpful for me to sometimes stop and ask: God, am I
really trusting you with all my heart in this job, with my future, or in this
relationship? Is there any way in which I am leaning on my own understanding
and/or trying to do things myself? Life would be so much easier and stress-free
if I could completely and fully surrender to God in everything that I do, and
this is something that I think God has highlighted as another area of growth.
Yet, the idea of completely surrendering is daunting, and I have to remind
myself continually that there is none better to completely surrender to than to
the creator of the universe who loves us more than we can ever imagine.<br/>
<br/>
One verse (or verses) that have been coming to mind are in Matthew 6 when it
talks about worry. I‚Äôve always liked the comparison that Jesus gives us when He
compares the care God has for the lilies of the field and the birds of the air
to how He cares for us. It‚Äôs another reminder of God‚Äôs faithfulness and love in
that of course, if He dresses the lilies and provides food for the birds, He
will care for us so much more. It‚Äôs with this mindset that I am ready and
willing to just embrace and enjoy my time with you, leaving my thoughts and
worries about the future and what may happen, to God. I am so thankful for the
times that we can spend together in-person, and I cherish every moment of them
as I know they cannot happen as often as I would like.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I am running out of time again to finish this letter üò≠. There‚Äôs always
more things that I‚Äôd like to add, but this summer has just been a battle of
trying to find time for different things. I love talking to you like this Jana,
and feel like I am getting more ‚Äúefficient‚Äù at it haha. Anyways, I‚Äôm so thankful
that I got to see you at your brother‚Äôs wedding. It was one of the most fun
times I have had in recent memory. See you again next weekend my Liefde. :)<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
<br/>
Christian
